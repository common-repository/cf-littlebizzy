#### Current Features ####

This plugin was designed to load faster, be more secure, and perform much better than the official CloudFlare plugin. We focus on offering only the key features desired by most developers, while allowing some of the other CloudFlare settings to be better managed at your account over at CloudFlare.com rather than turning WordPress into a bloated control panel with every setting possible which is nearly impossible to keep up with anyways (esp. with stable/secure code).

If you wish to define the CloudFlare API key and API email address on your `wp-config.php` or `functions.php` file you can do that to avoid your clients removing that data, especially during staging site syncing, migrations, etc. Plus it will load the data faster via PHP Opcache and server/Linux RAM memory caching rather than needing database queries or Options API cache.

You can also use those defined constants to better automate server/WordPress setup using bash scripts etc.

* one-click "dev" mode
* one-click purge CloudFlare cache
* automatic CloudFlare domain detection
* real visitor IP address sent to server/WordPress
* much lighter/faster code than "official" CloudFlare plugin
* uses CloudFlare API version 4.0+
* no integration with Akismet

#### Compatibility ####

This plugin has been designed for use on [SlickStack](https://slickstack.io) web servers with PHP 7.2 and MySQL 5.7 to achieve best performance. All of our plugins are meant for single site WordPress installations only; for both performance and usability reasons, we highly recommend avoiding WordPress Multisite for the vast majority of projects.

Any of our WordPress plugins may also be loaded as "Must-Use" plugins by using our free [Autoloader](https://github.com/littlebizzy/autoloader) script in the `mu-plugins` directory.

#### Disclaimer ####

We released this plugin in response to our managed hosting clients asking for better access to their server, and our primary goal will remain supporting that purpose. Although we are 100% open to fielding requests from the WordPress community, we kindly ask that you keep these conditions in mind, and refrain from slandering, threatening, or harassing our team members in order to get a feature added, or to otherwise get "free" support. The only place you should be contacting us is in our free [**Facebook group**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/littlebizzy/) which has been setup for this purpose, or via GitHub if you are an experienced developer. Thank you!

== Installation ==

1. Upload to `/wp-content/plugins/cf-littlebizzy`
2. Activate via WP Admin > Plugins
3. COnfigure at `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=cloudflare`

== FAQ ==

= How can I change this plugin's settings? =

Configure at `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=cloudflare`

= What version of the CloudFlare API is used? =

It currently uses CloudFlare API version 4.

= Does this plugin purge `cache everything` pages? =

No, it does not support caching HTML with CloudFlare, it is only meant to purge static resources. The "cache everything" option is generally not recommended for the vast majority of dynamic websites as it causes conflicts.

= Can I define the API key and email address? =

Yes you can use the supported defined constants to input the API key and email address in static PHP files like `wp-config.php` or `functions.php` to avoid database queries and data loss during staging sync or migrations.

= I have a suggestion, how can I let you know? =

Please avoid leaving negative reviews in order to get a feature implemented. Instead, join our free Facebook group.
